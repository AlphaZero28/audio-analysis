# audio-analysis
Development of MATLAB code has been done for time and frequency domain analysis. Time domain features such as peak values, RMS, zero crossing rate (ZCR) and autocorrelation can be calculated. These codes also provide calculation for one-sided FFT  spectrum and power density spectrum (PSD) using Welch's method.
